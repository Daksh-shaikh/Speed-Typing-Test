# Speed-Typing-Test

The Speed Typing Test is a Python program designed to help you improve your typing speed and accuracy. It presents a predefined text for you to type and provides instant feedback on your performance. By measuring the time it takes for you to complete the text, calculating your typing speed in words per minute, and evaluating your accuracy, you can track your progress and strive for faster and more accurate typing.

## Features
- Simple and easy-to-use program.
- Measures typing speed and accuracy.
- Provides instant feedback on performance.
- Customizable predefined text.
- Open-source and easily modifiable code.

## Usage
1. Install Python on your machine.
2. Clone this repository or download the code files.
3. Run the Python script `speed_typing_test.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the typing test.
5. View your test results, including time elapsed, words typed, typing speed, and accuracy.

## Customization
You can customize the predefined text by modifying the `text` variable in the `speed_typing_test.py` file. Feel free to replace it with your own text to suit your preferences or learning goals.

## Examples
Here is an example of how the Speed Typing Test looks when executed:

```
